# Taxi-Cab `Kata`

## Introduction

A local taxi-cab would like you to programme them a method which will
calculate the [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) 
between two points so that they can better estimate fuel expenditure.

## Your Task

Your task is to write a function `manhattanDistance(Point, Point)` that returns the Manhatten Distance between the two points.


## Rules

* The class `Point` is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation).
* The class `Point` has no public properties (the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
